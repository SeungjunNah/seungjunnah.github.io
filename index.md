I am a research scientist at NVIDIA.  
I received my Ph.D. from Department of ECE at Seoul National University, Korea, advised by [prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/faculty/).

## Research Interests

I am interested in generative AI and low-level computer vision problems including visual quality enhancement.
My recent research topics include image/video generation, deblurring, super-resolution, and neural network acceleration.
